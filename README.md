# NoSQL-Social-Network-API ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellowgreen)

For this project, I created a Social Network API application that is able to store, modify, and delete user data using NoSQL, Express, and Mongoose. Using insomnia to test the routes, a user can do the following:  

Create a new username.  
Update the new username's information.  
Get a list of all current usernames.  
Search for a username by a specific Id.  
Add/remove other current usernames as friends.  
Create thoughts that are linked to specific usernames.  
Get a list of all current thoughts, or a specific thought by id.  
Update current thoughts.  
Create/remove reactions linked to those thoughts.  
Delete a certain thought.  
Delete a specific username, and in doing so also delete all its linked thoughts and reactions as well.
